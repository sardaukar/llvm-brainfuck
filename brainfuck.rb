### Setup
#You will need the ruby-llvm gem for this to run. You will probably have to compile llvm 3.0 with
#
#      $ ./configure --enable-jit --enable-shared --enable-optimized
#      $ make && sudo make install
#
# Then you most likely will have to copy the llvm binary to a place where FFI finds it
# In my case this was
#
#      $ cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libLLVM-3.0.so.1 "~/.rvm/usr/lib/libLLVM-3.0.so"
#
# You can figure out where FFI looks for libraries by running
#
#      $ strace -o dump "ruby brainfuck.rb"
#      $ cat dump| grep open | grep llvm-3.0.so

#We will use this class to generate a LLVM module containing a single main function that executes our
#brainfuck program.
class Generator

#This method will add a function with the given `name` to the module given as `mod`. Its body will contain the compiled brainfuck `code`.
  def build(code,name, mod)

#Create a new function with the given `name`, taking no arguments, ad returning a single `LLVM::Int`
    mod.functions.add(name, [], LLVM::Int) do |f|
#LLVM handles code in so call **Basic Blocks**. A basic block is a linear
#sequence of instructions without incoming jumps. E.g. only the first
#instruction in a basic block can be jumped to / called to. However a basic
#block may jump/call to as many other basic blocks as it wants. Every basic
#block has to end in a jump to another block or a return.

#Create a basic block that is used as entry point of the function (remember we
#can only jump/call to the begin of a basic block)
      entry= f.basic_blocks.append("entry")
#We will need a loop that initializes the memory for our program, this loop
#needs a loop header `init_loop` that will check whether we have initialized all memory
#fields to 0 and a body `init_body` that will initializes a single memory cell to 0 per
#iteration then jumps back to the loop header. Finally we need the `body` of our
#function actually containing the brainfuck code.
      init_loop = f.basic_blocks.append("init loop")

#standard function `putchar` as external function which takes one `LLVM::Int`
#and returns another one
      @putchar = mod.functions.add("putchar", [LLVM::Int], LLVM::Int)
#Now we will start to construct the actual program. We use the `builder`
#object which allows us to add code to any given basic block
      entry.build do |builder|
#We create two stack variables, one containing the brainfuck pointer `@offset`,
#the other containing an array of 1000 `LLVM::Int` cells

#The offset will point to he first element of the array for initialization
        builder.store(LLVM::Int(0), @offset)
#br creates a `branch` or jump instruction. After setting up the stack space we
#will jump into the initialization loop
        builder.br init_loop
      end

#This is the header of the init loop, it checks if `@offset` points to the last
#element in the array. If it does the loop will be aborted and the real code
#begins, otherwise another iteration is performed.

#holds and to the init loop body `init_body` otherwise
        builder.cond( cmp , body, init_body)

        #Jump back to the loop header to check whether we are done

        #are used inside of the brainfuck program, thus we need to pass the function `f` as well.
